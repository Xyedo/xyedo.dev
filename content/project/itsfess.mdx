The feature that i proud of is

# The backend

The backend that we've built is using python and tweepy library for handling free twitter API.

We're not using the the webhook twitter API because its only for enterprise twitter API.

## Database

Database that we have built is using noSQL firebase firestore database because is just a simple user and many messages

# The Frontend

We are using next-js because its just building a website is so simple with react and its ecosystem and using next-auth for admin login.

## Home Page

The firebase client, is read only for live messages (yes its live, whenever the twit has been sent, its getting push to the itsfess-web) and we hidded the user if its not the admin.

## Admin Page

If user loggin, by that means, our admin is logged in, the user is shown and we give the option to report the user and delete the tweet
