Self balancing Robot is built by Arduino and some other libary and glued on using acrylics.

using a 2 DC motor and motor driver and using Arduino as a brain, and we have a gyroscope MPU6050 that use as a sensor to balancing the robot. we use PID method for balancing the robot

## Using Arduino

At first i built using Arduino and using some high level library, and having so many tutorial from the internet, because the arduino is only for prototyping.
you can check the working arduino code in [here]("https://github.com/Xyedo/Self-Balancing-Arduino-dmp")

## Using the STM32

and for production, we use the STM32 with HAL library and using PID with complimentary filter for balancing it out.
the working project code is [here]("https://github.com/Xyedo/STM32-Self-Balancing-HAL")

## What i've learn

<ul>
  <li>Learning how to control motor driver using arduino</li>
  <li>Learning how to using PID and how to calibrate them</li>
  <li>learning how to use a gyroscope sensor</li>
  <li>learning how to use settings and use the STM32 and HAL library</li>
  <li>learning how to use complimentary Filter with PID</li>
</ul>
